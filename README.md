# Toy App

This is a Rails exercise from Hartl's *Ruby On Rails Tutorial*, chapter 02

#### Takeaways
* Learned Rails' take on the Model-View-Controller design pattern
* Examined some of Rails' default scaffolding and REST architecture
* Beginner's intro to association between different data models
* Used Rails console for the first time
* Learned that since the Heroku deployment uses its own database (postgres) I have to also run 'heroku rake db:migrate'
* Practiced Heroku deployment again (starting to sink in)
